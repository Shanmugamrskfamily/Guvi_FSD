    This program is an HTML document that demonstrates the implementation of a form and table using HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation. The form includes fields for capturing user information such as first name, last name, address, pin code, gender, choice of food (selectable from multiple options), state, and country. Upon submitting the form, the entered values are appended to a table dynamically.

    With the help of JavaScript and DOM manipulation, form submission is intercepted and processed to extract the user-entered data. The extracted data is then used to create a new row in the table, effectively updating the table with the submitted information. After submission, the form fields are cleared to allow for the next data entry.

This is also deployed in Netlify. The link is given below,
